## Dependencies
This is a plugin for Sketch, so you need [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com). No other tool needed.

ddSpiral was created with Sketch Plugin Manager, so if you are planning to use the source code you'll probably need [SKPM](https://github.com/skpm/skpm) too. Together with [sketch-module-web-view](https://github.com/skpm/sketch-module-web-view/tree/master/docs).

## Installation
Download and double-click the plugin. Or drop it on the Sketch app. 

## What it does
You can make almost any spiral you want. Just select up to 2 objects and/or an open path and run ddSpiral from the plugin menu. The plugin presents you with an overlay for adjustments. You can update the spiral as long as you stay in the overlay.

## How it works
You can select up to 2 objects and an open path. The spiral will behave slightly differently accordingly. In any case, you can change the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise), the number of rotations (loops), the number of points per loop (tangents), the timing (linear, ease, ease-in or ease-out) and change the smoothness (0=sharp, 100=smooth, >100=experimental). The size and rotation of both start and finish is determined by the selected object(s), but you can also change these numbers.

### 1. Select a single object, such as an image, group, or symbol, and then run ddSpiral
If you select a single object, not a path, the spiral rotates from the bounding box to the center of the object. Position, size and rotation are inherited from the selected object. The spiral is drawn on top of the object in the same group.

### 2. Select a closed shape, like a rectangle, oval or any other custom closed path, and then run ddSpiral
Selecting a single closed path is basically the same as #1 but the option 'Force spiral into shape' becomes available. If the option is checked, the spiral extends from top to bottom, staying within the outer circumference of the object as much as possible rather than inside the bounding box. If you need a forced spiral in a different direction within the closed shape, you must first rotate your selected object and then flatten the shape before running ddSpiral.

### 3. Select an open path, thus a line, and then run ddSpiral
Choosing an open path and the spiral will stretch along the line. The 'Ease in/out' timing option swaps the end point and half way point, creating a symmetrical spiral.

### 4. Select two shapes or objects, and then run ddSpiral
The spiral is stretched from the first object to the second, using their coordinates, size and rotation. The first object is the object behind all others, not necessarily the first selected object. The spiral is drawn at the document level if both objects belong to a different group.

### 5. Select an open path and 1 or 2 other shapes or objects, and then run ddSpiral
This last option will also stretch the spiral along the path's route, like #3, but the dimensions are determined by the selected objects.

## Known issue
There is a known side effect that you can resolve yourself. Paths are made with b√©zier curves. The smoothness depends on the length of the path, in combination with the number of loops as well as the number of points per loop. If the combination doesn't match you can get unexpected turns. Especially if the route along an open path contains long or sharp turns. Try changing the path, number of loops or points for a better result. If you set the number of points very high, which you should not do of course, then you can see how the curve should actually run. Manually updating the tangents afterwards is of course also an option.

## Do you have any ideas or improvements?
The plugin must be bug free. If you find one, please let me know!

## Free
This plugin is free. You can use it as long as the Sketch API remains unchanged and you can also use the code to develop your own plugin. The code is as consistent as possible with lot's of comments. ddSpiral was my first plugin and the Sketch API documentation is, well, as good as it gets. Like always, important bits and pieces are missing, the examples that exist online are mostly outdated and the forum has recently been abandoned. Fortunately, there are quite a few well-written example plugins around that you can learn from also.
